                        Why Make Another CSS Framework?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="accordion-card__content">
                        <p>
                            As you may know, there are many CSS frameworks
                            (hundreds of them, and a lot of them are not
                            maintained today). Everybody can choose one that
                            suits their work style or project requirements. So
                            why make another one? It is certainly not because we
                            can do it better but because we want to do it our
                            way. We want to be in control and make decisions.

                        <p>
                            Each system is opinionated but on a different level;
                            this is valid for Spruce too. We don’t want to vote
                            for (strictly) any particular solution (because
                            there is always more than one), but we will show you
                            what we think is the best for us (and maybe for you
                            too). We don’t believe there is a good or bad
                            solution, but we can learn from any of them.

                        <p>
                            One controversial decision we made with Spruce is to
                            leave a classical grid system out. Because of the
                            late CSS layout model developments like Flexbox and
                            Grid, we think it can be eliminated; this doesn’t
                            mean that we won’t show you how to make layouts with
                            ease, but we try to make it the modern way.

                        <p>
                            Where it is possible, we use elements and/or
                            attributes to style elements, but it is still a
                            class-based framework.
